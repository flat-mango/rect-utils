# FlatMango.Core.Utils.Rect

This repository contains utilities to make working with [UnityEngine.Rect](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rect.html) more convenient. There are two variations available:
* static methods that change the original structure ([RectUtils](https://github.com/flat-mango/rect-utils/blob/v1.0/Assets/FlatMango/Core/Utils/Rect/RectUtils.cs))
* extension methods ([RectExtensions](https://github.com/flat-mango/rect-utils/blob/v1.0/Assets/FlatMango/Core/Utils/Rect/RectExtensions.cs))
